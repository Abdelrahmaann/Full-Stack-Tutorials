Whatâ€™s the difference between Scripting and Programming Languages?

	Basically, all scripting languages are programming languages. 
	The theoretical difference between the two is that scripting languages do not require the compilation step and are rather interpreted. 

	** For example, normally, a C program 		needs to be compiled before running 	whereas normally, a scripting 			language like JavaScript or PHP 		need not be compiled.
